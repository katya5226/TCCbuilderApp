We will have a global temperature vector, which will be between 0.0 and 2000.0 K in steps of 0.1 K.
Same for frequencies - other values of course, I need to yet determine.

Temperature range where properties are defined: 0 - 326 K
Problematic ranges: cp
(Popup appears: This material has defined properties in the range of 0 K - 326 K. Set constant cp for other ranges.)

Flags:
invariant  FALSE
temperature-induced phase change  FALSE
magnetocaloric  TRUE
electrocaloric  FALSE
barocaloric  FALSE
elastocaloric  FALSE
thermoelectric  FALSE
hysteresis  TRUE

Vectors:
magnetic_fields	YES
electric_fields	NO
pressures	NO
stresses	NO
permittivities at given frequencies	YES
rho	YES
cp - vector of vectors	NO
cp_heating - vector of vectors	YES
cp_cooling - vector of vectors	YES
k - vector of vectors	YES (one vector)
electric_res	NO
seebeck_coeff	NO
seebeck_coeff_der	NO

Non-vector data
rho	YES (RT, zero field)
cp	YES (RT, zero field)
k	YES (RT, zero field)
transition_temperature	YES (Tc)
latent_heat	NO
max_latent_heat	NO
