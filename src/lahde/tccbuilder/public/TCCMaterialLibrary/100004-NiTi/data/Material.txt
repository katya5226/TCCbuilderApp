We try to characterize the Nitinol that was used in https://doi.org/10.1007/s40940-016-0004-7.
In the paper, the thermal conductivity of the NiTi is given.
However, it is given just versus temperature and the hysteresis is not given.
From the graphs we can estimate that martensite-austenite transition occurs at approx. 339 K on heating
and the austenite-martensite transition occurs at approx. 307 K on cooling.

Specific heat capacity data is from Data from Zanotti 2010 (10.1016/j.intermet.2009.06.001).
The density can be estimated from https://matthey.com/en/products-and-services/medical-components/resource-library/nitinol-technical-properties on 24th January, 2022.

Melting point is taken from https://matthey.com/products-and-markets/other-markets/medical-components/resource-library/nitinol-technical-properties (07.08.23)
