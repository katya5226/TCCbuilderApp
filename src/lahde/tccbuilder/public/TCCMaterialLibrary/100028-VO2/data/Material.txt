As usual again, there are different values for different phases of VO2 with different crystal structures and properties

The dara is extracted from a publication that had all we need in it, othe publications are also listed below in case you needed them later on.

Data is from: C. L. Gomez-Heredia, Scientific reports, 2019, DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-51162-4

sample is hot pressed pelletes, which were fabricated in multiple different steps from powder. Pellets dimensions: Diameter (mm): 12.51 ± 0.02 and Thickness (µm): 763.8 ± 6.7. 
Note that the thickness is in microns. 


According to the article,  ρ= 4571 kg/m3 is the standard VO2 density
