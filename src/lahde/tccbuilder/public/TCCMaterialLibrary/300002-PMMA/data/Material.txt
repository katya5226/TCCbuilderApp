Poly(methyl methacrylate) - PMMA
We try to find the properties of PMMA, similar to those they used in 10.1039/c7cp02445b.
In the paper, only thermal conductivity is given.

Conductivity is taken as a constant, from https://doi.org/10.1007/s40940-016-0004-7
we see that it does not change much between 170 and 420 K.

Density and melting point are taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate) (07.08.23)
Specific heat capacity is taken from https://doi.org/10.1007/s40940-016-0004-7
Emissivity: https://doi.org/10.1007/s40940-016-0004-7
