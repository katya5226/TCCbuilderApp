Data From: Large Electrocaloric Effect in Ferroelectric Polymers Near Room Temperature. Bret Neese, Baojin Chu, Sheng-Guo Lu, Yong Wang, E. Furman, Q. M. Zhang. SCIENCE VOL 321 8 AUGUST 2008. DOI: 10.1126/science.1159655. Fig 1(a) The dielectric constant (K) of P(VDF-TrFE) 55/45 mol % copolymer films as a function of temperature measured at frequencies of 1, 10, and 100 kHz.

IMPORTNAT NOTE: In this paper they dont mention it, but in the thesis on Neese, it says that a totaly different sample, thickness of 9 microns made by solution casting from DMF at 70-80 degrees C with simillar annealing, has been used for DSC and determinning the 
		Owing to the nature of the graph and the overlaps in it, it was not possible to exactly pin point all the data points, therefore, small errors should be expected. The data in the thesis was not much better.
