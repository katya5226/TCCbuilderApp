@ 209 Electric Field

IMPORTANT NOTE:
1-Material 1 in the materials list. Polymer films prepared using a spincasting method on metalized glass substrates. Thickness in the range of 0.4 µm to 1 µm. 
2- Unit of the electric field is not mentioned clearly, most probably it is MV / m.
3- the simillar/identical curve in the thesis has a slightly different value at least for the 80 degrees data opint, it is clearly below 12
