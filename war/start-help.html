        Input time step, starting and boundary conditions on both sides.

        Periodic boundary condition is sinusoidal. Input mean temperature, amplitude, and frequency.

        Heat flux at the west boundary is considered as inlet heat flux; while at the east boundary, it is considered as outlet heat flux.

        If the simulation needs to run periodically, check the Cyclic box and add the parts of one full cycle.

        If a part requires a choice of components, add all components one by one, clicking Add Component each time.

        When all components relevant to that cycle part are added, click Add Cycle part.

        When all cycle parts are added, click Apply and the simulation starts.
