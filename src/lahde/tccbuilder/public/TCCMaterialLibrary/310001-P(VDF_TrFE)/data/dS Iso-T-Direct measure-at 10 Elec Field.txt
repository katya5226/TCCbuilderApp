@10 MV/m Electric Field

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
1-The material is probably the free-standing films fabricated using a solution cast method. Thickness in the range of 4 µm to 6 µm. 
2- The electric field for the "indirect data from Science" is not clearly mentioned here, however, in Fig 6 (b), which is the adiabatic temperature changes, it corresponds tor 134 MV / m field. Perhaps the same is true here as well.
3-I think the variations in ds is not that meaningful, it is within the errors of digitization, maybe we can consider it 0 if it makes physical sense
