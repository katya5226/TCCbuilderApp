@ 209 Electric Field
IMPORTANT NOTE:
1- Although not clearly mentioned here, but since Maxwell relations have been used, this data should be the indirect method and the material should be: Polymer films prepared using a spincasting method on metalized glass substrates. Thickness in the range of 0.4 µm to 1 µm. 
2- Unit of the electric field is not mentioned clearly, most probably it is MV / m.
