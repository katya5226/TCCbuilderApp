# TCCbuilderApp

The original code was forked from the project CircuitJS1 (Copyright(C) Paul Falstad and Iain Sharp, https://github.com/pfalstad/circuitjs1).
To build your own application, see the instructions available at https://github.com/pfalstad/circuitjs1 (README).

TCCbuilder is the world's first open-source tool for modelling macroscopic solid-state, mechanic, and fluidic thermal control elements (TCEs) and thermal control circuits (TCCs) with a graphical user interface and a library of materials and TCEs.
The library of materials contains relevant materials and their properties, that are needed for building and modelling of TCEs and TCCs. It is available at https://github.com/katya5226/TCCMaterialLibrary. Graphical representation of the properties is available at https://matview.tccbuilder.org/.
The library of TCEs contains some of the already built and tested TCEs from literature, especially their dimensions and effective values of thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and density. It is available at https://github.com/katya5226/TCE-Library.

The vision of TCCbuilder is to provide an important bridge between fundamental research and the development of real systems in the fields of cryogenics, energy conversion, microfluidics, biology, chemistry and pharmaceuticals, building, space, sensor technology and caloric cooling.
Researchers around the world are kindly invited to contribute to the project, whether to improve functionality or to add TCEs and materials to the library. Any feedback is also very welcome, fell free to post issues in any of the TCCbuilder repositories.

Live version of the app is available at  https://app.tccbuilder.org.
