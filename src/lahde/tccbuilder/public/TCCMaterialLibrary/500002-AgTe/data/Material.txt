Phase-change material Ag2Te
Data for thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity is taken from
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11664-020-07964-8

Specific heat capacity is coverted from molar values using molar mass 343.34 g/mol,
calculated using this site: https://www.webqc.org/ (08.08.23)

Density and melting point are obtained from Google on 08.08.23.
