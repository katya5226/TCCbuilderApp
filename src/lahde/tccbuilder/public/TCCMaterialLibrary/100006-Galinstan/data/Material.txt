Galinstan (R) is a brand name for an alloy composed of gallium, indium, and tin
which melts at -19 °C (-2 °F) and is thus liquid at room temperature. (Wikipedia, 21st August 2023)
rho = 6440 kg/m3, cp = 296 J/kg/K
Thermal conductivity: 16.5 W·m-1·K-1

Boiling point: > 1300 °C

Some info on emissivity was found in
