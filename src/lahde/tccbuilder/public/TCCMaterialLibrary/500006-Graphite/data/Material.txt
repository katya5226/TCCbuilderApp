Bulk graphite

We guess the thermal conductivity from paper http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2014.03.004
is neither out of plane neither in plane, but somewhere in between.
To obtain a somewhat larger temperature range, we extract the data for k from https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1330693 (McEligot - Thermal properties of G-348 Graphite).
We also give in-plane and out-of-plane thermal conductivities for similar material (bulk grafite),
data from Fugallo 2014 (dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl502059f).

Specific heat capacity:
Data from DeSorbo 1953 for temperature range 13-300 K (10.1063/1.1698640)
Data from Butland 1973 for temperature range 300-4000 K (10.1016/0022-3115(73)90060-3)

Density:
In the Integiris Brochure (https://www.entegris.com/content/dam/web/resources/brochures/brochure-properties-and-characteristics-of-graphite-7329.pdf) it is
stated that "commercial, polycrystalline graphites seldom exceed 80 percent of the theoretical density (2260 kg/m3) due to voids and pores".
Data from McEligot - Thermal Properties of G-348 Graphite (2016). Values are taken as mean values of two samples.

Emissivity:
Taken from Shu - Research on the normal emissivity of graphite between 150 and 500 °C by an infrared camera for nuclear fusion devices
(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nme.2022.101182) We extrapolated the data to 0 °C.
